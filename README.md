# Byreal API Docs

This repository is a collection of Byreal API documentation.
It is designed as an entry point for developers and integrators to quickly find each service's API spec, request/response examples, and usage notes.

## Service Documentation

- Router Service: [router.md](./router.md)

## How to Use

1. Open the service doc from the list above.
2. Follow endpoint/request/response definitions in each file.
3. Keep this README updated when new service docs are added.

## Contributing Docs

When adding a new service document:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the repository root (for example: `order.md`).
2. Add the link in `README.md` under `Service Documentation`.
3. Use clear sections like `Overview`, `Endpoint`, `Request`, and `Response` for consistency.
